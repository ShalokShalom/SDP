# SDP

Short for "systemd-packages" 

The CLI part, that powers Linda. 

# Linda - Containerized systemd-packages 

Benefits

1.) Installation of Compilations

  Linda allows you to combine different applications - like VSCode with compiler and all other tools, you might use - and bundle them within a single       
  nspwan container. 
  
2.) Updates and Applications

  While staticly released distributions offer outdated software, are rolling distributions tied to updating the system together with the applications. 
  With Linda, you can update, install and run user applications without the need to reboot the underlying system *on a rolling system*. 
  
  It will also be always up to date, opposite to a standard release. 
  
3.) Preconfigurations and Backups

  The applications within the Linda ecosystem can be configured and then be shared both online and local. This also creates the opportunity to use Linda as   a backup system.
