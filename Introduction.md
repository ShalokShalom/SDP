# Linda - Containerized Applications for Linux

## Implementation

Linda is based on Ruby, Ruby on Rails, systemd-nspawn and lot's ot other, small applications. 

## Benefits

1.) Installation of Compilations

  Linda allows you to combine different applications and bundle them within a single nspwan container. 
  Like VSCode with a couple of compiler and runtime environments, to create your optimal developer suite.
  Ready to download and share worldwide. 
  
2.) Updates and Applications

  While staticly released distributions offer outdated software, rolling distributions are tied to updating the system together with the applications. 
  With Linda, you can update, install and run user applications without the need to reboot the computer *on a rolling system*. 
  
  It will also be always up to date, opposite to a standard release. 
  
3.) Preconfigurations and Backups

  The applications within the Linda ecosystem can be configured and then be shared online and locally as an application-setup backup system.
